* Hashing allows to store object (groups of fields such as a user) in Redis and individual fields of these objects can be accessed to update.

# Adding a hash set (saving user with ID 1, age 20 and city Sydney)
hset  user:1 name Sam age 20 city Sydney

# Fetching a single field value of a hash
hget user:1 name

# Fetching all values only (without keys)
hvals user:1

# Fetching all keys and values of a hash
hgetall user:1

# Fetching all keys of a hash
hkeys user:1

# check if fields exists (return 1 or 0)
hexists user:1 name

# Removing a specific field
hdel user:1 name

# Expiring the hash (in 20 seconds)
expire user:1 20
